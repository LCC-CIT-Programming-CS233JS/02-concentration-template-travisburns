![concentrationgamesaffari](https://github.com/LCC-CIT-Programming-CS233JS/02-concentration-template-travisburns/assets/41456635/d4bd6489-d605-4354-bf37-56c50430615e)

## Project Overview
* A concentration game with 20 cards (10 pairs)
* Cards are initially face down
* Players click to reveal cards, trying to find matching pairs
* Game tracks matches and tries
* Uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality

## Features
- Interactive gameplay with 20 cards
- Tracks number of matches and tries
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Bootstrap 5.2.1)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Click on cards to reveal them
4. Try to find all matching pairs with the fewest tries

## Key Learning Points
1. HTML Structure:
   * Use of Bootstrap grid system for layout
   * Semantic HTML elements

2. CSS Styling:
   * Custom styling for cards
   * Use of background images for cards

3. JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming:
   * Creation of a Concentration class to encapsulate game logic
   * Use of constructor and methods

4. DOM Manipulation:
   * Dynamically updating card images
   * Enabling/disabling cards based on game state

5. Event Handling:
   * Implementing click events for cards

6. Game Logic:
   * Implementing card matching logic
   * Tracking game state (matches, tries)

7. Asynchronous JavaScript:
   * Use of setTimeout for delayed actions (e.g., flipping cards back)

8. Array Manipulation:
   * Filling and shuffling an array of card images

9. ES6+ Features:
   * Use of let and const for variable declarations
   * Arrow functions

10. Code Organization:
    * Separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for behavior)
    * Modular code structure within the Concentration class

11. Responsive Design:
    * Use of Bootstrap classes for responsiveness
